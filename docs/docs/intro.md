:::caution

Before proceeding, it is important to note that __we DO NOT support Spring/Spring Boot paradigm__.
[ChatbotWS] runs as a **[JAX-RS]** webservice backed by its reference implementation [Jersey] running
as a WAR inside [Jetty] container.

More info about difference between JAX-RS and Spring can be found in [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42955575)
